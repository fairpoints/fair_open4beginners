### Community session:

**Event 1:**

* FAIR can be done in “small bites” - people should make progress in adopting new practices, and this may be more successful than trying to implement or make lots of new changes at once.  
* Open Science exists, introduce it in a gentle way to do away with the skeptism around openness. Communicating these skeptisms 
* FAIR does not mean open, it's possible to be FAIR but that does not mean all data is shared. Levels of openness.  Training will show the contrast differences between Open and FAIR ( the terms are not interchangeable).
* Open and FAIR are often confused, Important that early stage researchers and under graduates know about Open Science and FAIR and learn to implement these concepts early on in their planning phase. Implement the concepts in the DMPs set up for the project.
* Treat data the same way as other scientific practices. Just like in the wet lab the data has to be neat and clean and taken care of.
* Early in your training and career is the best time to start learning good data habits. (e.g., commenting and documenting what you are doing)
* Sensitising the early career students about open science will make a great impact in realising the importance of open science
* Big data is different than small data - habits for data management with small data may not serve you as well when you work with larger data 

**Potential learning outcomes**

* Know the difference between Open science and FAIR 
* Understand the importance of Open and FAIR as a student and a professional researcher 
* Good habits you can start with to make your science open and your data FAIR
* Transfer your good laboratory habits to working with data (i.e., keep it neat, labelled, and organised)
* Know that it is create new good habits than change old bad habits - learning about Open and FAIR now is a good objective

**Event 2:**

* Introducing what Open means and how do researchers work? Or what is typically a research process? 
    * Research process can be anything that is testable using the scientific method
* What Open covers? Narrative and description of the open science ‘boundaries’ as an example. IP, copyrights and Open use licences.
* Describing the research process (scientific method) 
* Researchers produce different types of research outputs (e.g. data, publications, software)
* Open Access categories?
* All research outputs should be shared openly because:
    * Transparency
    * Reproducibility
    * Reuse 
    * Public money, moral obligation to share? 
    * Equity access to knowledge
    * Increases trust in the quality of research, whether it is from undergraduate or not, if it’s good quality, it will be more likely to be used 
* Why is this important and why should they invest in this? How to make strong arguments for open and fair. 
* Do you need help with what you’re doing? Open brings other people to help you, FAIR makes it easier for machines and computers to help you. 
* 

Learning outcomes:

* Base motivation on why Open and FAIR

Audience: Highschool, citizens

Easy:


* What is research process

Audience: Undergraduates, ERC?

Medium:



* Audience: ERC + researchers with more than 3-5 years?

Advanced:
