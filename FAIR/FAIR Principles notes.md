### Script for trainers:

Data and Datasets

    Define what data/information is.


    E.g. 'the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question' (Concordat on Open Research Data) plus examples


    Relate _homework_ to what they are doing. 


    Their instragram, photos on the phone, etc. 


    ‘Data rules our world’


    ‘Metadata is to help your future self’

    FAIR principles


    Findability:

* If it’s findable, you might be able to use it later on in your life to build up on it in the future.
* How do you make it findable? Naming is important, 
    * bad example v.s. Good example
* How do you determine interoperability? What is interoperable?
* Good example: student with the same student ID should be identified between datasets stored (e.g. in local school and the Ministry of Education).

A running example? To make it relevant.
